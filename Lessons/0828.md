## For loops
```.py
number = input("enter a number: ")
#validate that the user entered a number
for letter in number:
    if letter not in "0123456789":
        print("Number not valid, try again.")
        exit()
# factors = []
num = int(number)
for i in range(2,num-1):
    if num % i == 0:
        print(f"{i} is a factor of {num}")
#         factors.append(i)
# print(factors)
```
