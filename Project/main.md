# Criterion A: Planning

## Problem definition (more specific)
My client, Silco, is the owner of the Zaun Company. His employees are suffering from security breaches, where unauthorized individuals gain access and even controls to sensitive company information and systems. In the past they have used basic password management, such as physically recording passwords and relying on individual memory, but it presents many limitations, like people forgetting passwords, writing them physically on paper and postits that anyone can see, or using weak passwords that can easily get hacked. My client is concerned about...
## Proposed Solution
I propose to create a hidden and secure password manager software for my client, this solves their problems because:
* 

## Success Criteria (Be more specific than this, more specific = better)
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("vand3r"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
