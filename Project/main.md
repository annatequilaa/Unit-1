# Criterion A: Planning

## Problem definition (more specific)
My client, Silco, is the owner of the Zaun Company. His employees are suffering from security breaches, where unauthorized individuals gain access and even controls to sensitive company information and systems. In the past, they have stored passwords physically or relied on memorization. However, this presents many limitations. When people memorize their passwords, they are prone to forgetting passwords and taking extra time to retrieve it, or setting weak and repetitive passwords for different websites, which can be easily hacked into. Furthermore, people recording the passwords physically on paper and postits have the risk of the physical objects being accessible to everyone, hence not having much security. My client is concerned about future cycber attacks. 

## Proposed Solution
I propose to create a hidden and secure password manager software for my client, this solves their problems because:
* The software isn't physical and accessible to everyone. Only a user with the secret code will be able to access the content, hence reducing the risks of getting cyber attacked. 
* The software will store the password and username in a file and cypher it so when an employee forgets their password, it is accessible but also secure. This way, people can also use stronger passwords without the fear of forgetting it.
* The software's password managing feature will be masked with a daily-use feature such as calculator or to-do list. This way, the employees could keep the software with them at all times, with the password managing feature not being accessible to anyone who has access to the device with the software. 

## Success Criteria (Be more specific than this, more specific = better)
1. The to-do list feature should accept user input to add, delete, mark as complete, and undo tasks on a list. 
1. The to-do list can handle typical errors (e.g., no input, duplicated tasks) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("vand3r"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely by cyphering it. 
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
