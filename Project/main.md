# Criterion A: Planning

## Problem definition (more specific)
My client, Silco, is the owner of the Zaun Company. His employees are suffering from security breaches, where unauthorized individuals gain access and even controls to sensitive company information and systems. In the past they have used basic password management, such as physically recording passwords and relying on individual memory, but it presents many limitations, like people forgetting passwords, writing them physically on paper and postits that anyone can see, or using weak passwords that can easily get hacked. [My client is concerned about...???]
## Proposed Solution
I propose to create a hidden and secure password manager software for my client, this solves their problems because:
* The software isn't physical and accessible to everyone. Only a user with the secret code will be able to access the content, hence reducing the risks of getting cyber attacked. 
* The software will store the password and username in a file and cypher it so when an employee forgets their password, it is accessible but also secure. This way, people can also use stronger passwords without the fear of forgetting it. 

## Success Criteria (Be more specific than this, more specific = better)
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("vand3r"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely by cyphering it. 
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
